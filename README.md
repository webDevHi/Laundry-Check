                                Project Overview
    Projects are one of the best ways to learn computer science, so I decided to embark on my first independent one a little early. I was inspired to do this project because of a problem in my daily life. I lived in a dorm freshman year, and it sometimes felt impossible to know when the laundry room was full, so, this web app will track the washers and dryers, displaying which ones are being used as well as the remaing time they have before finishing. 

    Objectives/Skills portrayed: As this is my first full project, I try to showcase every introductory web developer skill possible. In this project, I use html to build the bones of the application, and css to style it in a proffessional and easily understood fashion. I also use Javascript to give the project functionability, allowing users to reserve washers or dryers.
